## Requirements 
The project is written in Python 3, with only one requirement, numpy==1.17.4.

Use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install project requirements (just numpy)

If unable to run this locally, heres a link to run it online. You will need a repl.it account (it's free) to do so though, and can only run main.py.

## main.py
The entry point for a custom run is main.py. It will prompt you to enter values for each parameter.

To run, `python3 main.py`

## tests.py
This is the file used for generating tests used for the report (see report.pdf). It generates a file tests.csv with results from all the runs.

To run, `python3 tests.py`

The file report_data.csv is the exact data used for the report.
